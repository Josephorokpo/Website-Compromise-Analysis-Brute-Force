# **Cybersecurity Incident Report: Website Compromise via Brute Force**

## **Incident Summary**

Multiple customers of yummyrecipesforme.com reported being prompted to download a file for "free recipes," leading to browser redirection to greatrecipesforme.com and subsequent computer slowdowns. Investigation confirmed the website was compromised via a brute force attack on the administrative account, allowing a former employee to inject malicious JavaScript, leading to malware delivery and redirection.

## **1\. Network Protocol Identification**

During the investigation, the following network protocols were identified as critical to understanding the incident:

* **Domain Name System (DNS) \- UDP Protocol (Port 53):**  
  * **Role:** Used to resolve human-readable domain names (e.g., yummyrecipesforme.com, greatrecipesforme.com) into machine-readable IP addresses.  
  * **Observation:** The tcpdump log clearly shows DNS queries (UDP) from your.machine to dns.google.domain (the DNS server) and responses providing the corresponding IP addresses for both yummyrecipesforme.com and later greatrecipesforme.com. This protocol was essential for the browser to locate both the legitimate and malicious web servers.  
* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) \- TCP Protocol (Port 80/443):**  
  * **Role:** Used for transmitting web pages and other web content between a web server and a client's browser. While the scenario implies HTTPS (port 443\) for the website, the tcpdump log explicitly shows http (port 80\) in the info column, indicating the web content itself was likely served over HTTP after the initial DNS resolution.  
  * **Observation:** The log shows TCP handshakes (\[S\], \[S.\], \[.\]) followed by HTTP GET requests for the webpage from your.machine to yummyrecipesforme.com. This protocol was used to deliver the compromised webpage containing the malicious JavaScript. It was also used later to request content from greatrecipesforme.com.

The incident primarily leveraged the fundamental functionality of these protocols for name resolution and web content delivery, twisting them to deliver malware and redirect users.

## **2\. Incident Documentation**

### **Problem First Reported:**

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme.com's helpdesk, complaining about being prompted to download a file, subsequent website address changes, and personal computers running slowly.

### **Scenario, Events, and Symptoms Identified:**

* **Scenario:** A former disgruntled employee gained unauthorized access to yummyrecipesforme.com's web host.  
* **Initial Compromise Event:** The attacker performed a **brute force attack** on the administrative account, repeatedly guessing known default passwords until the correct one was found. There were no controls in place to prevent this.  
* **Exploitation:** After gaining login credentials, the attacker accessed the admin panel and modified the website's source code.  
* **Malware Injection:** A JavaScript function was embedded into the source code of yummyrecipesforme.com that prompted visitors to download and run an executable file upon visiting the website.  
* **Post-Compromise Action:** The hacker changed the administrative account password to lock out legitimate owners.  
* **User Experience (Symptoms):**  
  * Visitors to yummyrecipesforme.com were prompted to download a file for "free recipes."  
  * After running the file, the browser redirected to a different URL (greatrecipesforme.com).  
  * Users' personal computers began running more slowly.  
* **Discovery:** The website owner was unable to log in to the admin panel and contacted the hosting provider. Cybersecurity analysts were tasked with investigating.  
* **Investigation Steps (Analyst's Actions):**  
  * Replicated the issue in a sandbox environment.  
  * Used tcpdump to capture network traffic during website loading.  
  * Observed the prompt to download an executable file ("update your browser").  
  * Accepted the download and ran the file.  
  * Observed browser redirection from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.  
* **Evidence from Senior Analyst:** Confirmed website compromise, identified injected JavaScript code prompting file download, and confirmed the downloaded file contained a script for redirection.

### **Current Status of the Issue:**

The yummyrecipesforme.com website has been compromised, leading to the delivery of malware and redirection of users. The administrative account was breached due to a brute force attack exploiting a weak/default password and lack of preventative controls. Security engineers are now managing the incident, while analysts have completed the initial investigation and documentation.

### **Information Discovered While Investigating:**

* **Initial Access:** Brute force attack on the administrative web host account.  
* **Vulnerability Exploited:** Default/weak administrative password and absence of brute force prevention controls.  
* **Malicious Payload Delivery:** Injected JavaScript in yummyrecipesforme.com's source code.  
* **Malware Mechanism:** Prompts users to download and run an executable file.  
* **Redirection:** The downloaded file contains a script that redirects the user's browser from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.  
* **Network Protocol Flow:**  
  1. DNS query for yummyrecipesforme.com (UDP)  
  2. DNS response with IP for yummyrecipesforme.com (UDP)  
  3. HTTP request for yummyrecipesforme.com (TCP)  
  4. (Implicit: Web server delivers compromised HTML/JS)  
  5. (Implicit: User executes downloaded malware)  
  6. DNS query for greatrecipesforme.com (UDP)  
  7. DNS response with IP for greatrecipesforme.com (UDP)  
  8. HTTP request for greatrecipesforme.com (TCP)  
* **Impact on Users:** Slowed personal computers, unexpected file downloads, and redirection to a malicious site.

### **Next Steps in Troubleshooting and Resolving the Issue:**

1. **Secure Administrative Accounts:** Immediately reset all administrative passwords on the web host to strong, unique values. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.  
2. **Cleanse Compromised Website:** Remove the malicious JavaScript code from yummyrecipesforme.com's source code. Restore the website from a known clean backup if available.  
3. **Malware Analysis:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the downloaded executable file to understand its full capabilities and potential impact on user machines.  
4. **Block Malicious Domains/IPs:** Add greatrecipesforme.com and its associated IP address (192.0.2.17) to internal blacklists (firewalls, DNS filters).  
5. **User Notification & Remediation:** Inform affected customers about the incident, advise them to scan their computers for malware, and provide guidance on removing any malicious files.  
6. **Implement Brute Force Prevention:** Deploy security measures to prevent future brute force attacks (detailed in the next section).  
7. **Review Access Logs:** Analyze web server and admin panel access logs for other suspicious activity related to the brute force attack.

### **Suspected Root Cause of the Problem:**

The suspected root cause is the **lack of robust brute force prevention controls and the use of a weak/default administrative password** on the web host. This allowed the former employee to easily gain unauthorized access, leading to the website compromise and subsequent malware distribution.

## **3\. Recommendation for Brute Force Attacks Prevention**

**Recommendation: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative and user accounts.**

### **Why MFA is Effective:**

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly enhances security against brute force attacks by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. Even if an attacker successfully guesses or cracks a password (the first factor) through brute force, they would still need access to a second, independent factor (e.g., a code from a mobile authenticator app, a fingerprint, a hardware token, or a one-time code sent via SMS/email). This makes it exponentially harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access, as compromising two different types of credentials is far more challenging than just one. MFA acts as a critical barrier, preventing a single compromised password from leading to a full account takeover.
